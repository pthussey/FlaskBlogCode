# FlaskWebsiteCode
This is the code for my own personal website I built using Flask which can be found at http://www.paulhussey.kr/.

I used python version 3.9.7, and you should be able to recreate my development environment with the requirements or yaml file.  
Note that if you use the yaml file to create a conda environment, you will need to separately pip install the Flask-FlatPages and emoji packages into your environment.
